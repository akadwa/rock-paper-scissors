## Rock Paper Scissors Project

In this project I've created a simple Rock Paper Scissors Game to better my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

Learning about the DOM has been quite tricky but I've tried my best to adapt to and learn as much about it as I can. 

NOTE: My commits during the branching stage were not as frequent and thorough as they were required to be. This is due to my misunderstanding on the branching however I will correct this in the future.
